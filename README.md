# LibZoomer

A library that allows other mods to create zooms and custom spyglasses easily. The target is Minecraft 1.17+, since that version introduces spyglasses.

## Usage

Calm down, the mod isn't ready yet! Also, don't use it as an API yet, the initial release still have to come and I won't have mercy on the API.

## Download

This mod is not available for download yet, and even if it was, it's meant to be JiJ'd by mods, so you wouldn't need to download it at all.
