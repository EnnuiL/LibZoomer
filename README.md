# LibZoomer

A library that allows other mods to create zooms and custom spyglasses easily. Currently has the basics done but it's still being polished for usage by Ok Zoomer (and also for other mods).

The target is Minecraft 1.17+, since that version introduces spyglasses.

## Usage

Calm down, the mod isn't ready yet! Also, don't use it as an API yet, Michael is still here and I will break API stuff.

## Download

This mod is not available for download yet, and even if it was, it's meant to be JiJ'd by mods, so you wouldn't need to download it at all.
